# Backpacks

A tiered backpack mod made for the Metamorphosis server. If you're not on that
server, then I'm not really sure how you found this mod.

## Backpacks

All backpacks can be worn in the chest slot, enabling the player to access 
the backpack inventory in a new tab of their survival inventory. Extra backpacks
can be placed on the ground and accessed just like a chest. To pick up a 
backpack on the ground, sneak + right click it. All backpacks are dyeable!
